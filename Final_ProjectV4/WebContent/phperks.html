	   	<p>The Philippines has some incredible destinations. I'll start with the phenomenal rice terraces of Banaue and Batad, high in the Cordillara Mountains of Luzon. For three days, I trekked among what I consider one of the grandest human construction achievements on earth. It is worth flying to the Philippines to see these alone. I also heard many great things about the remote island of Palawan, with its famed Underground River. The beaches and diving off the islands of the Visayas are some of the world's best. Personally I liked the little mountain getaway town of Sagada and the colonial city of Vigan. The beaches of Bantayan and Malapascua were my favorites.

   		<p><div id="title">The people</div>Filipinos are friendly. They're also very respectful and modest. (The same goes for Filipino expats and emigrants; they are consistently the friendliest and most upbeat people I've come across in my travels.) The Philippine Archipelago is made up of 7,000 islands stretching across more than a thousand kilometers. It was settled by Malays and before that was home to several indigenous groups. Over the centuries, the Chinese have had traded with peoples of the Philippines and there was great influence by Spanish and American colonial rule. All of these influences have created an interesting mix of inhabitants that still have diverse cultures, festivals, 
   														cuisines, as well as speaking at least 150 different languages.
   														
   		<p><div id="title">English</div>English is the means by which Filipinos from different parts of the country communicate with one another. It is also the language of formal education. This is good for travelers, €”not because I think everyone should know English, but because it allows the traveler to have more meaningful interactions with Filipinos. I was able to chat with the old guy on the bus, talk to the kid on the beach collecting seashells, and learn about processing rice by hand from a woman in a rural village. And no doubt, it just makes getting information about a
   											 hotel room, or your next bus or ferry, a lot easier.
   		<p><div id="title">Visa</div>The good news is: you get a 21-day visa for free on arrival. More good news is that visa renewal is a relatively easy process at any provincial office. The bad news is: it'€™s expensive. I paid $75 to get an additional seven days. Part of this was bad planning on my part; I should have only stayed 21 days. That's what I recommend to you: limit your travels in the Philippines to less to 21 days or less.
   		<p><div id="title">Crime</div>First, I'll say that I took above-average precaution and had zero issues with crime. I think the Philippines is safer than everyone says it is, but I may be wrong. There are armed guards outside nearly every business (including fast food restaurants!). Filipinos are the first ones to tell you how dangerous their country is. They'€™re the ones with their backpacks on their front side. As a traveler, I would be aware of the issue, but no need to be paranoid and don'€™t let 
   										safety prevent you from visiting the Philippines.
