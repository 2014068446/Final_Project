	   	<div id="title">At a glance</div><p>The Pahiyas Festival, originally known as Feast of San Isidro is an annual religious celebration honoring San Isidro, the patron saint of farmers. It showcases houses decorated with colorful "kiping" accented with farm produce such as rice, fruits, plants, and vegetables as a way
	   	of thanksgiving for the bountiful harvests. Other events were added to attract tourists like the parade of carabaos, floats, sunduan, parikitan, and higantes and a trade fair known as  Tiyangge sa Lucban. Officially, the festival is known as the Lucban San Isidro Pahiyas Festival
	   	and listed by the Department of Tourism as one of the most colorful tourist attractions in the Philippines.

   		<p><div id="title">A short History</div>The festival's name comes from the Filipino terms hiyas (jewel) and pahiyas (precious offering). This feast is an ancienct farmers' harvest celebration that dates back to the 16th century. According to legend, San Isidro Labrador magically plowed the field whenever he went
   		out of the church. This is the story of that the Spaniards passed on to the Philippines from Mexico during their colonial period. Since then, the Pahiyas Festival has been a source of excitement for the locals and visitors of Quezon Province.
   														
   		<p><div id="title">Highlights</div>The highlight of the festival is a procession along the streets of the image of San Isidro Labrador, to ensure the people's bountiful harvest in the coming seasons. The procession features a pair of giant papier mache figures of a farmer and his wife. This is followed by the image of the patron saint and his wife Sta. Maria de la Cabeza, who carries a basket with triangulo biscuits, which are given to the children during the procession. This culminates with generous sharing of food among the townspeople.
   		<p><div id="title">Customs</div>All the locals' houses are decorated with agricultural harvest (fruits, vegetables, rice grains, rice stalks, flowers, and ferns) and colorful rice wafers, called kiping. These thin wafers made from rice dough are usually arranged into two or three layers of chandeliers called aranya. The locals use different kinds of leaves to add flavor and color to the kiping. They also produce varieties of tastes and textures by using different ingredients such as kabal, coffee, talisay (umbrella tree), cocoa, and banaba leaves.
Each house tries to outdo each other in decorations in an annual competition as they vie for the honor of being recognized for their creativity. After the competition is over and the awards are handed over to the owners of the winning house, the decorations of the house will be thrown away to the huge flock of people as free treats. For the other houses, after the festival, those kipings that were used as decorations are cooked and eaten as rice chips. Also during the festival, the people display their harvest in front of their homes so that the parish priest can bless them as the procession passes by.
